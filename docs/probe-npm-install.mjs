/**
 * Install this package into a throwaway dsh profile exactly the way a stranger
 * would, then answer the question the repository cannot answer about itself:
 * does the published tarball actually become a running plugin?
 *
 * Everything else in this repository tests the code. `verify-policy.mjs` reads
 * the decision out of the source and the demo renders the chip from a fixture,
 * and both of those pass on a package that installs into nothing. The wiring
 * that turns a tarball into a plugin lives in three files that no other check
 * opens: `package.json` (which names the package), `cordis.patch.yml` (which
 * names it a second time, to the host), and `dsh.client.inject` (which names
 * what the client half needs before it may run). A typo in `cordis.patch.yml`
 * produces a plugin that installs cleanly, registers cleanly, and never loads.
 *
 * Usage: node docs/probe-npm-install.mjs [<spec>]   (default: the published package)

 * The default is the registry spec, not a local tarball. Installing the version
 * that is actually published is the thing a stranger does; reading the tarball
 * only proves the tarball is fine. Pass a path to test a local pack instead.
 *
 * The version is pinned, and that is the whole point of this probe. A bare name
 * does NOT resolve to `latest`: pnpm 11 ships a release cooldown (its built-in
 * `minimumReleaseAge`), so for 24 hours after a publish `pnpm add <name>` picks
 * the newest version older than the window and writes that range into the
 * profile. Asking for the bare name therefore tests the *previous* release --
 * measured on the sibling package in this workspace, a bare name resolved to a
 * version three releases old while the probe printed "a stranger can install
 * this". Naming the version makes the probe test the thing under test; the
 * assertion below then checks that what landed is what we meant to ship.
 *
 * `dsh plugin add github:tuoLuoSuan/dsh-peak-badge` takes a different road and
 * is not subject to the cooldown, which is why the README keeps both.
