// The whole policy is a pure function of the Beijing wall clock plus the
// statutory holiday table below, so this half is self-contained: no network, no
// host RPC. It must never load a clock or a timer from the ambient globals —
// browser timers are trapped in a client half, and the disposable interval comes
// from the `timer` service instead.
//
// Policy (api-docs.deepseek.com/zh-cn/quick_start/pricing):
//   "北京时间周一至周五（不含中国法定节假日）9:00 - 12:00、14:00 - 18:00 为高峰时段；
//    其余时段，包括周末及中国法定节假日全天均为空闲时段。"
//   "空闲时段价格为高峰时段价格的一半。"
// The English page says the same thing in UTC ("01:00 - 04:00 and 06:00 - 10:00
// UTC, Monday through Friday, excluding Chinese public holidays" = the two local
// windows above) and repeats that weekends and holidays are off-peak in full.
// So weekends really have no peak window at all: do not "fix" this file into a
// seven-day schedule.

// The factory scope is the only safe place for a binding: bundle files are
// concatenated into page-global `<script>`s, and every shipped bundle keeps its
// top level to the single `load(...)` call for exactly that reason. Hence the id
// appears twice — this call and the `PACKAGE_ID` inside the factory — and the two
// must be changed together.

    // Each becomes `color-mix(in srgb, base floor%, tint alpha%)`, so the variable
    // still EXISTS and a `var(token, #fallback)` never falls back. Reading the
    // static palette instead is what makes the fill opaque regardless of which
    // plugins rewrite the aliases.
    //   chip -> --dsw-static-neutral-bluish-00 / -850, i.e. exactly the two values
    //           `--dsw-specific-input-major` resolves to without the plugin, so the
    //           solid chip matches the composer surface in both themes.
    //   card -> --dsw-static-neutral-bluish-150 / -875, the opaque pair behind
    //           `--dsw-alias-bg-overlay`. The card floats over the wallpaper rather
    //           than sitting in the composer, so it takes the panel shade (the
    //           wallpaper plugin's own solid panel colour is bluish-875 on dark).
    //
    // Each fill then takes a LITTLE of the wallpaper's own colour, so a solid
    // surface still belongs to the picture instead of sitting on it like a sticker.
    // The tint is --we-surface-tint-light/-dark, the wallpaper plugin's own
    // wall-derived colour (it clamps it into a readable luminance band per theme
    // before publishing it). The weight is the complement of the plugin's
    // --we-wallpaper-opacity, so the tint appears with the wallpaper and vanishes
    // with it. Two rules keep the blend honest:
    //   - the mix stays 100% opaque. There is no `transparent` operand anywhere, so
    //     the result cannot become a window, and the verifier refuses one that does.
    //   - the tint weight follows the plugin's own wallpaper-opacity: at the default
    //     fully-faded wallpaper (`--we-wallpaper-opacity: 0`) the weight is 0 and the
    //     fill is exactly the static colour, so nothing changes until the user
    //     actually shows a wallpaper. Because that is the value the plugin REMOVES
    //     when no wallpaper is opaque (`s.removeProperty('--we-wallpaper-opacity')`),
    //     the `0` fallback also covers "plugin not installed" — the math works out
    //     to the plain static fill in every case.
    // The weights are 25% (chip) and 30% (card), measured rather than guessed: at
    // 12-14% the whole move was 4 units of RGB (a #b98f5e wall colour on bluish-150
    // landed on #e9ecf1, i.e. invisible), because the plugin clamps its tint into a
    // readable luminance band and a light wall colour is already close to a light
    // base. The verifier proves the ceiling instead: the theme's own saturated amber
    // (--dsw-alias-state-warn-primary) at 25% still leaves 5.0:1 for the 12px chip
    // label, and at 50% it would not. The card takes more than the chip because it
    // is the larger surface, and the chip is the one carrying coloured text.
    // `color-mix()` percentage arguments are `<percentage> | <calc-sum>`, so a
    // weight that follows the wallpaper's opacity is expressible — but only in some
    // spellings. Measured in the engine this ships to (Edge/Chromium, via
    // `.tmp-probe3.mjs`), `calc(25% * (1 - var(--we-wallpaper-opacity, 0)))` is
    // ACCEPTED BY CSS.supports() AND THEN SILENTLY DROPPED at computed-value time,
    // which leaves the plain declaration above as the fill and therefore no tint at
    // all — a failure that looks exactly like a working tint in a screenshot.
    // `calc(25% * (1 - var(--we-wallpaper-opacity, 0)))` resolves correctly
    // (verified in the same probe), so that is the form used here and the form the
    // verifier requires. Without the plugin the whole `var()` resolves through its
    // fallback and the declaration still parses; a `var()` that resolved to NOTHING
    // would make the declaration invalid at computed-value time and drop the fill to
    // `transparent`, which is the exact failure this component is written to avoid.
